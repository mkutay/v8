# Catter

This is a minimal and responsive blog created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [MDX](https://github.com/ipikuka/next-mdx-remote-client), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [Shadcn's UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components. Catter

- has support for Markdown and MDX,
- has a custom designed comment system,
- has view counter for every post,
- has a page where anyone on the internet can sign and mark their presence,
- has LaTeX support in markdown,
- has a page for projects you do,
- has a system for tags for posts,
- uses [CodeHike](https://codehike.org/) for beautifully designed code blocks.

See my [blog](https://www.mkutay.dev) for a working example that is based on this repository.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Copy `.env.example` and populate `.env.local`. Use GitHub, Discord, and Spotify OAuth for guestbook and comments. Also, add the information from your Postgres database you use. In addition, you don't need to run any commands manually to set the database schema, as it is automatically done by Catter.

Change the values in `config/site.ts` to change the config of your site. Importantly, add your email to `admins` to access the admin page on your site, where you can delete comments and guestbook entries.
