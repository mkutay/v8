Last week in my philosophy class, we talked about how we are changing every second. For instance, I am not the same person when I started writing this blog, or my friends are not the same when I see them the next day. Then I wondered what would happen if we were all the same and didn't change for the rest of our lives. There are advantages to this; to give an example, there will be no discrimination; for instance, if someone discriminates against another person, that person will discriminate against themselves because they are the same. A bad thing that comes to my mind is that someone has to rule a group of people, but what is different between the ruler and the followers? This can create chaos. 

What if we were all the same and we were perfect in every way possible too? This, in my opinion, may result in the ideal race. There would be no crimes or anything that might be classified as bad. Everyone would know what to do, and there would be an order that would not be broken indefinitely. Even while all of this would be fantastic, it is simply not possible. This was just a silly blog entry. I just wanted to share my ideas with you. If you have any more ideas, you can just write a comment.
