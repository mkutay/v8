title: Maclaurin and Taylor Series
description: A presentation that Kutay gave on Maclaurin Series for IB Mathematics AA.
date: 2024-02-27
excerpt: I decided to do a presentation on Maclaurin series for Maths AA HL class, which is in the curriculum. I made the slides for the presentation using Beamer (with LaTeX), and honestly, it was great. By the way, I kind of utilised 3B1B's technique of teaching. Taylor ~~Swift~~ Series (Maclaurin Series), a joke.
