For my second project centering web development and UI design, I decided to create a dictionary for
sland phrases and words in Turkish. I created a input for searching and designed components around it.

I used <Link href="https://nextjs.org/">Next.js</Link> with <Link href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">Shadcn's UI components</Link>.
While I set out to transcribe every word and phrase in a book titled "Türkçenin Büyük Argo Sözlüğü," but I soon realised
that it is really hard to transcribe from a book that is 25 years old. In any case, I created the site to look really nice,
even though the search function probably is the slowest thing you'll ever see.

- <Link href="https://argo-sozlugu.mkutay.dev/">See the website for yourself.</Link>
- The GitHub repo is not public for the time being, but if I return to this project in the future, I definitely want to 
make it open source so that anyone can both add words and phrases, and improve the website.
